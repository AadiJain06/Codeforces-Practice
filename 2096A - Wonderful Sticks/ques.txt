→ Virtual participation
Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

A. Wonderful Sticks
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are the proud owner of n
 sticks. Each stick has an integer length from 1
 to n
. The lengths of the sticks are distinct.

You want to arrange the sticks in a row. There is a string s
 of length n−1
 that describes the requirements of the arrangement.

Specifically, for each i
 from 1
 to n−1
:

If si=<
, then the length of the stick at position i+1
 must be smaller than all sticks before it;
If si=>
, then the length of the stick at position i+1
 must be larger than all sticks before it.
Find any valid arrangement of sticks. We can show that an answer always exists.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤500
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤100
) — the number of sticks.

The second line of each test case contains a single string s
 of length n−1
 consisting of characters <
 and >
 — describing the requirements of the arrangement.

Output
For each test case, output n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
, the ai
 are distinct) — the lengths of the sticks in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Note
For the first test case, the requirements of the arrangement are as follows:

s1=<
, which means a2
 is smaller than a1
.
Thus, one possible arrangement is [2,1]
.

For the second test case, the requirements of the arrangement are as follows:

s1=<
, which means a2
 is smaller than a1
;
s2=<
, which means a3
 is smaller than a1
 and a2
;
s3=>
, which means a4
 is larger than a1
, a2
, and a3
;
s4=<
, which means a5
 is smaller than a1
, a2
, a3
, and a4
.
Thus, one possible arrangement is [4,3,2,5,1]
.
