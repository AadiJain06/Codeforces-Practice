→ Virtual participation
Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

A. LRC and VIP
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You have an array a
 of size n
 — a1,a2,…an
.

You need to divide the n
 elements into 2
 sequences B
 and C
, satisfying the following conditions:

Each element belongs to exactly one sequence.
Both sequences B
 and C
 contain at least one element.
gcd
 (B1,B2,…,B|B|)≠gcd(C1,C2,…,C|C|)
 ∗
∗
gcd(x,y)
 denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x
 and y
.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤500
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
 (2≤n≤100
).

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤104
).

Output
For each test case, first output Yes
 if a solution exists or No
 if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example YES
 and yEs
 will also be accepted.

Only when there is a solution, output n
 integers on the second line. The i
-th number should be either 1
 or 2
. 1
 represents that the element belongs to sequence B
 and 2
 represents that the element belongs to sequence C
.

You should guarantee that 1
 and 2
 both appear at least once.

Note
In the first test case, B=[51,9]
 and C=[1,20]
. You can verify gcd(B1,B2)=3≠1=gcd(C1,C2)
.

In the second test case, it is impossible to find a solution. For example, suppose you distributed the first 3
 elements to array B
 and then the last element to array C
. You have B=[5,5,5]
 and C=[5]
, but gcd(B1,B2,B3)=5=gcd(C1)
. Hence it is invalid.
