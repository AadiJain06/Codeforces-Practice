→ Virtual participation
Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

One can notice the following remarkable mathematical fact: the number 2025
 can be represented as (20+25)2
.

You are given a year represented by a string s
, consisting of exactly 4
 characters. Thus, leading zeros are allowed in the year representation. For example, "0001", "0185", "1375" are valid year representations. You need to express it in the form (a+b)2
, where a
 and b
 are non-negative integers, or determine that it is impossible.

For example, if s
 = "0001", you can choose a=0
, b=1
, and write the year as (0+1)2=1
.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The following lines describe the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s
, consisting of exactly 4
 characters. Each character is a digit from 0
 to 9
.

Output
On a separate line for each test case, output:

Two numbers a
 and b
 (a,b≥0
) such that (a+b)2=s
, if they exist. If there are multiple suitable pairs, you may output any of them.
The number −1
 otherwise.
