→ Virtual participation
Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

For a permutation p
 of length n
∗
, we define the function:

f(p)=∑i=1n|pi−i|

You are given a number n
. You need to compute how many distinct values the function f(p)
 can take when considering all possible permutations of the numbers from 1
 to n
.

∗
A permutation of length n
 is an array consisting of n
 distinct integers from 1
 to n
 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]
 is a permutation, but [1,2,2]
 is not a permutation (2
 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]
 is also not a permutation (n=3
 but there is 4
 in the array).

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤100
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
 (1≤n≤500
) — the number of numbers in the permutations.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of distinct values of the function f(p)
 for the given length of permutations.

Note
Consider the first two examples of the input.

For n=2
, there are only 2
 permutations — [1,2]
 and [2,1]
. f([1,2])=|1−1|+|2−2|=0
, f([2,1])=|2−1|+|1−2|=1+1=2
. Thus, the function takes 2
 distinct values.

For n=3
, there are already 6
 permutations: [1,2,3]
, [1,3,2]
, [2,1,3]
, [2,3,1]
, [3,1,2]
, [3,2,1]
, the function values of which will be 0,2,2,4,4
, and 4
 respectively, meaning there are a total of 3
 values.
