→ Virtual participation
Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

A. Fashionable Array
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
In 2077, everything became fashionable among robots, even arrays...

We will call an array of integers a
 fashionable if min(a)+max(a)
 is divisible by 2
 without a remainder, where min(a)
 — the value of the minimum element of the array a
, and max(a)
 — the value of the maximum element of the array a
.

You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an
. In one operation, you can remove any element from this array. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array a
 fashionable.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤103
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n
 (1≤n≤50
) — the size of the array a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤50
) — the elements of the array a
.

Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the array a
 fashionable.

Note
In the first test case, at least one element needs to be removed since min(a)+max(a)=2+5=7
, and 7
 is not divisible by 2
. If any of the elements are removed, only one element will remain. Then max(a)+min(a)
 will be divisible by 2
.

In the second test case, nothing needs to be removed since min(a)+max(a)=1+9=10
, and 10
 is divisible by 2
.

In the third test case, you can remove the elements with values 2
 and 4
, then min(a)+max(a)=5+11=16
, and 16
 is divisible by 2
.
