Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

A. Vadim's Collection
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
We call a phone number a beautiful if it is a string of 10
 digits, where the i
-th digit from the left is at least 10−i
. That is, the first digit must be at least 9
, the second at least 8
, …
, with the last digit being at least 0
.

For example, 9988776655 is a beautiful phone number, while 9099999999 is not, since the second digit, which is 0
, is less than 8
.

Vadim has a beautiful phone number. He wants to rearrange its digits in such a way that the result is the smallest possible beautiful phone number. Help Vadim solve this problem.

Please note that the phone numbers are compared as integers.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s
 of length 10
, consisting of digits. It is guaranteed that s
 is a beautiful phone number.

Output
For each test case, output a single string of length 10
 — the smallest possible beautiful phone number that Vadim can obtain.

9899999999
Note
In the first test case, for the first phone number 9999999999, regardless of the rearrangement of digits, the same phone number is obtained.

In the second test case, for the phone number 9988776655, it can be proven that 9876556789 is the smallest phone number that can be obtained by rearranging the digits.
