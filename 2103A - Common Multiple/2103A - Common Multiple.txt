→ Virtual participation
Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an
. An array x1,x2,…,xm
 is beautiful if there exists an array y1,y2,…,ym
 such that the elements of y
 are distinct (in other words, yi≠yj
 for all 1≤i<j≤m
), and the product of xi
 and yi
 is the same for all 1≤i≤m
 (in other words, xi⋅yi=xj⋅yj
 for all 1≤i<j≤m
).

Your task is to determine the maximum size of a subsequence∗
 of array a
 that is beautiful.

∗
A sequence b
 is a subsequence of a sequence a
 if b
 can be obtained from a
 by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤500
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤100
) — the length of the array a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
) — the elements of array a
.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n
 over all test cases.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum size of a subsequence of array a
 that is beautiful.

Note
In the first test case, the entire array a=[1,2,3]
 is already beautiful. A possible array y
 is [6,3,2]
, which is valid since the elements of y
 are distinct, and 1⋅6=2⋅3=3⋅2
.

In the second test case, the subsequence [3,1,4,5]
 is beautiful. A possible array y
 is [20,60,15,12]
. It can be proven that the entire array a=[3,1,4,1,5]
 is not beautiful, so the maximum size of a subsequence of array a
 that is beautiful is 4
.
